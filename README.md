A suggestion for a video rating system on YouTube.

## Summary
![COPPA Summary](./COPPA_Summary.png)

## Purpose
This repository contains assets for a suggested video rating system that YouTubers and other online content creators may use free of change and without royalties (although sharing is appreciated). The system is inspired by the [Pan European Game Information (PEGI)](https://pegi.info) rating system for video games because besides the age rating it also describes why the age rating has been chosen.

## Assets
Find the age rating labels under [age-ratings](./age-ratings). The content rating labels are located under [content-ratings](./content-ratings). If need be, you can use the Photoshop files to modify them as you need.
You will need to download and install the font "[Blue Highway](https://www.dafont.com/de/blue-highway.font)".

## How to apply
### Age Rating
The age rating can be chosen pretty freely. However depending on the content, a minimum age rating may be required. The age rating is split between the following ratings:

- **7+**: Intended for viewers of age 7 and up
- **13+**: Intended for viewers of age 13 and up
- **16+**: Intended for viewers of age 16 and up
- **18+**: Not intended for viewers below 18

### Content Description
To further describe your content for viewers, also add one or more icons describing your content. In this first draft, the following categories are provided:

- **Animation**: The video features animated content (in any way). This will not influence the rating of the video.
- **Bad Language**: The video features bad language, like swearing or sexual expletives. Mild swearing might only require an age rating of 13+ while stronger language would require higher ratings.
- **Politics**: The video contains political content. Depending on the topic, the age rating should be increased, but 13+ should be used as a minimum.
- **Video Games**: The video contains depictions video games. The age rating should be adjusted depending on the games age rating (PEGI, USK, ESRB, etc.).
- **Violence**: The video features depictions of violence. While non-realistic or non-detailed violence might not require an increase in age ratings, increase in realism and details should be considered. As an orientation, use [PEGI's "Violence" label guideline](https://pegi.info/what-do-the-labels-mean).
